**Kyber-K2SO** is a clean implementation of the [Kyber](https://pq-crystals.org/kyber) IND-CCA2-secure key encapsulation mechanism (KEM), whose security is based on the hardness of solving the learning-with-errors (LWE) problem over module lattices. Kyber is one of the candidate algorithms submitted to the [NIST post-quantum cryptography project](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Post-Quantum-Cryptography).

## Security Disclaimer

ðŸš¨ Extensive effort has been undertaken in order to ensure the correctness, interoperability, safety and reliability of this library. Furthermore, it is unlikely that the API will change in the future. While this library is likely ready for production use, it is offered as-is, and without a guarantee.

## Features & Usage

Keeping in mind the Security Disclaimer above, Kyber-K2SO appears to be appropriate for use in any environment supported by Go: client-side application, server-side applications and more. All operations take no more than a few milliseconds on regular computing hardware.

### Features

* **Small, easy to read code.** Kyber-K2SO is to our knowledge the smallest implementation of Kyber Version 3.
* **Simple API.** `KemKeypair768()` to generate a private key and a public key, `KemEncrypt768(publicKey)` generate and encrypt a shared secret, and `KemDecrypt768(ciphertext, privateKey)` to decrypt the shared secret. Aside from Kyber-768, Kyber-512 and Kyber-1024 are also offered.
* **Good performance.** Kyber-K2SO is more than fast enough for regular usage in any environment supported by the Go programming language.
* **Constant time (probably).** As far as we can tell, decryption appears to perform in constant time. Further analysis is encouraged.

### Using Kyber-K2SO

```bash
go get -u github.com/symbolicsoft/kyber-k2so
```

```go
package main

import (
	kyberk2so "github.com/symbolicsoft/kyber-k2so"
)

func main() {
	privateKey, publicKey, _ := kyberk2so.KemKeypair768()
	ciphertext, ssA, _ := kyberk2so.KemEncrypt768(publicKey)
	ssB, _ := kyberk2so.KemDecrypt768(ciphertext, privateKey)
}
```

Replace `768` with `512` or `1024` in the above function names in order to call Kyber-512 or Kyber-1024 instead of Kyber-768.

## About Kyber-K2SO

Kyber-K2SO is published by [Symbolic Software](https://symbolic.software) under the MIT License.

Kyber-K2SO originally implemented Kyber version 2. Kyber-K2SO was subsequently updated in version 0.1.0 to implement Kyber version 3 thanks to work contributed by [Anton Tutoveanu](https://github.com/antontutoveanu) in March 2021.

We thank [Peter Schwabe](https://cryptojedi.org/peter) for his feedback during the development of this implementation.
