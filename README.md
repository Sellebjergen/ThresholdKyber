# Threshold Kyber


## Ideas
Analysing the parameters - extending the scripts / looking at them. 
- distributing the key generation 

Implementing the system as in gladius.
- Preprocessing
- Other?

Extending by using chinese remainder theorem - as on the whiteboard.

Monotone boolean scheme from katharina and Peters article. (last secret share)

Robustness of peter and katharinas article
- weak = decryption fails
- strong = you can corrupt some but not all and still get decryption


## TODO
- [ ] Make CBD byte operation more efficient by removing the need for uint8. \
- [ ] Update params to be taken from a struct to increase modulo q \
- [ ] Update bounds in the constants to adhere for the newly chosen modulo q. \
- [ ] Update Gasussian Samplong to use cryptograÃ¥hically safe randomness \
- [ ] Update paramsPolyvecCompressedBytes variables for k > 3 \
- [ ] Fixing inner product in MP SPDZ \
- [ ] Write about inner product in report \
- [ ] Implementing Distributed key generation in MP SPDZ \
- [x] Write about distributed key generation in report \
- [ ] Update preliminaries with quotient rings etc. (half page that every article has) \
- [ ] Update preliminaries with notation \
- [ ] Formal definition and properties of LSS \
- [ ] strong 0, 1-reconstruction \
- [ ] rewrite pictures of hybrid constructions into some algorithm tex library \
- [ ] Inserting code fragments in implementation section \
- [ ] Benchmark MP SPDZ vs golang implementation \


## Ideas further
- [ ] Zero knowledge for distributed key generation
